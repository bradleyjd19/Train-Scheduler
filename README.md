# Train-Scheduler

All Aboard for Approximation Station! This app will estimate the next arrival time for your train; just input the train name, destination, the first time the train leaves the station (AM/PM), and how often the train stops at the station (frequency). If you hear the whistle (CHOO CHOO), the next arrival time and how long until it arrives will display in the Current Train Schedule.
